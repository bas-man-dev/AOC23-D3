## Part 1
Going to start by trying to go through the lines, find the symbols, then check all around the symbols for numbers
check top left and round? Remember to either make a fake outside row or logic for side pieces/corners.
Probably going to also have to do a left/right check also?
How about go left until pos to left is empty then capture the group of digits as far right as it goes?
